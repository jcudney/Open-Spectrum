            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Trans 101, an educational resource designed to provide a foundational understanding of transgender identities, experiences, and terminology. This guide aims to be accessible to everyone, whether you're questioning your own gender identity, supporting someone who is transgender, or someone who wants to be a better ally.</p>
            
            <p>This resource covers basic concepts and terminology, but it's important to remember that every transgender person's experience is unique. No single resource can capture the full diversity of transgender experiences, and terminology continues to evolve.</p>

          <h2>What Does "Transgender" Mean?</h2>
          <p>"Transgender" (or simply "trans") is a broad umbrella term used to describe people whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. For example, someone assigned female at birth who identifies as a man may call himself a transgender man, or simply a man. Likewise, someone assigned male at birth who identifies as a woman may identify as a transgender woman.</p>
          
          <p>Not all trans people transition in the same way, and not all choose to change their name, pronouns, appearance, or undergo medical transition. Being trans is about identity—not about your body or presentation.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Sex vs. Gender</h3>
                <p><strong>Sex</strong> typically refers to biological characteristics including chromosomes, hormones, and physical anatomy.</p>
                <p><strong>Gender</strong> refers to the social and cultural roles, behaviors, and attributes that a society considers appropriate for men, women, or others.</p>
                <p><strong>Gender identity</strong> is one's internal sense of their own gender, which may or may not align with the sex assigned at birth.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Gender Spectrum</h3>
            <p>Rather than being limited to just "male" and "female," gender exists on a spectrum with many possible identities and expressions. This spectrum includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Binary identities (man/woman)</li>
                <li>Non-binary identities</li>
                <li>Fluid identities that may change over time</li>
                <li>Culturally-specific gender identities found across different societies</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Gender Expression</h3>
            <p>Gender expression refers to how someone presents their gender through clothing, hairstyle, mannerisms, name, pronouns, and other outward characteristics. Gender expression may or may not align with gender identity or social expectations.</p>

        <section id="trans-umbrella">
            <h2>The Trans Umbrella</h2>
            <p>The terms “transgender” or "trans" are often used as umbrella terms to refer to many different gender identities. Some key examples of transgender identities are explained below:</p>

            </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="pronouns">
            <h2>Pronouns & Names</h2>
            <p>Using someone's correct pronouns and name is a simple way to show respect for their identity.</p>
            
            <h3>Common Pronouns</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>She/Her/Hers</li>
                <li>He/Him/His</li>
                <li>They/Them/Theirs</li>

            <h3>Using Pronouns Respectfully</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask people which pronouns they use.</li>
                <li>Share your own pronouns when introducing yourself.</li>
                <li>If you make a mistake, apologize briefly, correct yourself, and move on.</li>
                <li>Practice using unfamiliar pronouns.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Names Matter</h3>
                <p>Using a transgender person's chosen name is important for affirming their identity. Continuing to use a previous name (deadnaming) can be hurtful and disrespectful.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="transition">
            <h2>Gender Transition</h2>
            <p>Transition is the process of changing one's gender presentation and/or sex characteristics to align with their gender identity. Transition is highly individualized, and not all transgender people transition in the same way or to the same extent.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Transition</h3>
            <div class="card">
                <h4>Social Transition</h4>
                <p>Changes to social expression and presentation, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Names and pronouns</li>
                    <li>Clothing and appearance</li>
                    <li>Voice and speech patterns</li>
                    <li>Legal documents (ID, passport, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h4>Medical Transition</h4>
                <p>Some transgender people pursue medical interventions, which may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hormone Therapy:</strong> Hormone Replacement Therapy, or HRT, involves the use of perscription hormones and hormone blockers to change the hormones within a patient's body. This can cause long term feminizing or masculinizing effects such as changes in fat distribution, hair, skin, and more. </li>
                    <li><strong>Various Surgical Procedures:</strong> There are a wide variety of surgical procedures that can be done to help transgender individuals, however some of the most commonly discussed are facial feminization surgery (FFS), and Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS). Two common forms or SRS are a vaginoplasty, where a penis is surgically altered to create a vaginal canal, and phalloplasty, where skin grafts are used to create a penis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Voice Therapy:</strong> Voice therapy or Voice training is the practice of training one's voice to better affirm their gender identity. This process typically does not involve any surgical procedures.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Not all transgender people want or need medical transition, and medical status is never a requirement for validating someone's gender identity.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Every transition is unique, and there is no "right way" to be transgender. Some people transition in all aspects of their lives, while others may only transition in certain contexts or in specific ways.</p>
