                <h2>Things to Consider Before Coming Out</h2>
                <p>Before coming out, it’s okay to take time to think through your options and needs. Some helpful questions might include:</p>
                <div class="card">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Is this a safe time and place to share this part of myself?</li>
                    <li>Who do I trust to support me?</li>
                    <li>What do I want to share, and what am I not ready to?</li>
                    <li>How might this change my relationships or environment?</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <p>It’s okay to come out in stages, to only tell certain people, or to wait until you feel ready. Safety and mental well-being come first.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Start with Someone Supportive:</strong> Telling one trusted person can help you feel less alone and build confidence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> If you're nervous, write down what you want to say or practice with a friend.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Resources:</strong> Coming out letters or similar materials can help you plan out what you'll say or find the words that feel right.</li>
                    <li><strong>Set boundaries:</strong> You don’t have to answer every question, and you don’t owe anyone full access to your identity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare for Mixed Reactions:</strong> Not everyone will respond perfectly or kindly. That is in no way a reflection of your worth.</li>

                <h2>It is Okay to Stay Private</h2>
                <p>Some people choose to never come out publicly, and that’s valid too. </p>
                <p>Others choose to stop telling people they're trans once they get to a point where they are considered cis passing. This is referred to by some members of the trans community as being "stealth".</p>
                <p>Whether you’re out to everyone, a few people, or just yourself, you are still real, valid, and trans enough.</p>

              <div class="card">
                <p>If someone comes out to you:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Listen with respect</strong> and without judgment.</li>
                  <li>Use their <strong>chosen name and pronouns.</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Thank them for trusting you.</strong> For many transgender people the process of coming out can be incredibly scary. Taking the steps to come out shows a great deal of trust.</li>
                  <li>Don’t share their identity with others without <strong>permission.</strong></li>
