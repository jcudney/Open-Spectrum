        <h1>Dysphoria and Euphoria</h1>
        <p>Gender dysphoria and gender euphoria are important concepts that help explain how trans and nonbinary people may feel about their bodies, identities, and how they're seen by others.</p>

        <p>Dysphoria often highlights what feels wrong or uncomfortable—while euphoria helps show what feels right. Understanding both can be a powerful part of exploring your identity and finding what affirms you. </p>

                <h2>What is Gender Dysphoria?</h2>
                <p>Gender dysphoria refers to the distress someone may feel when their gender identity doesn’t align with the sex they were assigned at birth.</p>
                
                <p>This can affect how a person feels about their body, their name, pronouns, or how they're perceived by others.</p>

                <div class="card">
                  <h3>Dysphoria May Feel Like:</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical Discomfort:</strong> Discomfort with certain physical features (like chest, voice, or facial hair)</li>
                    <li><strong>Emotional Distress:</strong> Emotional distress when being misgendered</li>
                    <li><strong>Anxiety and/or Depression:</strong> Anxiety or depression linked to feeling “trapped” in the wrong gender role</li>
                    <li><strong>Disconnection from Self:</strong> Feeling disconnected from one's own reflection or voice</li>
                  </ul>
              </div>

              <p>It's important to know: Not all trans people experience dysphoria—and experiencing dysphoria doesn't make someone “more” or “less” trans. Every experience is valid.</p>

                <h3>How to Handle Dysphoria</h3>
                <p>Gender dysphoria can be overwhelming, but you're not alone—and there are ways to manage those feelings with care and support.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Affirm your Identity:</strong> Wear clothes, use names, or present yourself in ways that feel most "you," even in small ways.</li>
                  <li><strong>Limit exposure to dysphoria triggers:</strong> This might include mirrors, certain social situations, or gendered spaces. It's okay to set boundaries.</li>
                  <li><strong>Find Community:</strong> Talking to other trans people who understand can be incredibly validating. Online and in-person support groups can help.</li>
                  <li><strong>Seek gender-affirming care:</strong> If you're interested and able, things like voice training, therapy, HRT, or surgery may help relieve dysphoria over time.</li>
                  <p>General, Medical, and Legal resources are all listed under the Resources tab of TransCompass. These resources can help deal educate further and provide assistance in dealihg with gender dysphoria.</p>

                <h2>What is Gender Euphoria?</h2>
                <p>Gender euphoria is the positive side of gender identity—it’s the joy, comfort, or sense of rightness that comes when your gender identity is recognized, affirmed, or expressed in a way that feels true to you.</p>
                
                <div class="card">
                  <h3>Euphoria May Feel Like:</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Joy</strong> when being called by your correct name or pronouns</li>
                    <li>A deep <strong>sense of peace</strong> wearing clothes that reflect your gender identity</li>
                    <li>Looking in the mirror and <strong>feeling excited or whole</strong></li>
                    <li>Being <strong>seen and respected</strong> for who you are</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>Gender euphoria is just as important as dysphoria in understanding trans experiences. For many people, it’s what guides their transition or self-discovery journey.</p>

                    <p>For years, trans narratives were centered almost entirely around dysphoria. But joy, pride, and euphoria are also core parts of trans life. By recognizing both the struggles and the triumphs, we create a fuller, more compassionate picture of what it means to be transgender.</p>
