            <h2>What is Allyship?</h2>
            <p>Being an ally to transgender people means more than having good intentions—it means showing up with respect, taking time to learn, and using your voice to help create safer, more inclusive spaces.</p>
            
            <p>You don’t have to be perfect to be an ally. What matters most is your willingness to listen, grow, and stand beside trans people in both quiet and visible ways.</p>

            <h2>Being an Ally</h2>
            <p>Allies play an important role in creating inclusive environments for transgender people.</p>
            
            <h3>Ways to Be an Ally</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Educate yourself about transgender issues (like you're doing now!).</li>
                <li>Use correct names and pronouns.</li>
                <li>Listen to transgender people's experiences.</li>
                <li>Speak up against transphobia and discrimination.</li>
                <li>Respect privacy — don't ask invasive questions.</li>
                <li>Support transgender rights and inclusive policies.</li>
                <li>Acknowledge when you make mistakes and commit to doing better.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Being an ally isn't about getting everything right all the time. It's about listening, learning, and continuously working to create a world where everyone can live authentically.</p>

            <h2>Common Myths & Misconceptions</h2>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h4>Myth: Being transgender is a choice or trend.</h4>
                <p>Fact: Gender identity is a deeply held internal sense of self, not a choice or trend. Transgender people have existed throughout human history across all cultures.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h4>Myth: All transgender people undergo surgery.</h4>
                <p>Fact: Medical transition is personal and varies widely. Many transgender people don't pursue surgical procedures for various reasons including personal preference, medical access, or financial constraints.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h4>Myth: You can tell if someone is transgender by looking at them.</h4>
                <p>Fact: Transgender people are diverse in their appearances, just like cisgender people. Many transgender people are not visibly distinguishable from cisgender people.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h4>Myth: Transgender identity is a mental illness.</h4>
                <p>Fact: Being transgender is not a mental illness. While gender dysphoria is recognized in diagnostic manuals, the distress it causes is the focus of treatment, not the gender identity itself.</p>
